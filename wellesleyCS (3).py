WellesleyCS Chatbot is a friendly FAQ bot to help navigate common questions 
related to the CS Department at Wellesley College.

The chatbot structure is based on that of chat.eliza. Thus, it uses
a translation table to convert from question to response
i.e. "I am" --> "you are"

Of course, since WellesleyCS Chatbot does not understand the meaning of any words,
responses are very limited. WellesleyCS Chatbot will usually answer very vaguely, or
respond to a question by asking a different question, in much the same way
as WellesleyCS.

# COMPUTER SCIENCE IN GENERAL
# Below are number of regexes aiming to respond to questions regarding the general questions of computer science.
# In particular, the most important aspect was to notice that people have different methods of saying certain things
# i.e., a positive word could be "cool", but it could also be "best".
# Thus we had to list couple of synonymous words that people may potentially use to ask such questions.
# This could be done with the | which shows the "or", or with (.*)? that would catch anything that goes in between certain words.
